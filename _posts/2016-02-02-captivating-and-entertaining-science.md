# Captivating and Entertaining Science

<article style=""><h1>Captivating and entertaining Science</h1><p>The winners and coaches of FameLab 2015</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6de1c05dd27f0ecd237f978ac99e6164736535c2.jpg" /></article>

My name is _Oskari Vinko _and I can help you capture attention, deliver a convincing message and give an impression that you master your topic. I have worked my way from stage fright and shyness to an internationally renown science communicator. I won world's largest science communication competition, FameLab, in 2015 and I've been invited to speak in several European countries.

> I have worked my way from stage fright and shyness to an internationally renown science communicator

I did my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics and Mathematics focusing on Systems Sciences and minoring at Computational and Cognitive Biosciences at Aalto University, Finland. I studied Molecular Biosciences at University of Helsinki and currently, I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Biotechnology, majoring Synthetic Biology, at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Our department of Biosystems Science and Engineering is located in Basel, the crossroads of Switzerland, France and Germany. I have a wide background from Physics, and Computer Science to Life Sciences. This makes it easier for me to grasp concepts from very different fields and to explain them in simple and understandable way to general public, or scientific audience.
